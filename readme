A snake is initialized around an image boundary either with the help of a user or a high level process.
To guide a snake to a nearby feature in an image, an energy functional is designed which tries to minimize itself continuously and thus locking the snake onto nearby image.
Weights associated with different energy functional determines which feature of the image will be more dominant to attract the snake towards itself
We can Apply Filters to the image to get better results
Snake is create around an image by selecting initial “n”points using getpts
A spline is created using above n points using spline
Spring Forces has been implemented to bring snake out of local Minima.
